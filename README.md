# ManufacturingPlant_networksystem

## Project Description
This project provides a solution for connecting multiple devices in a manufacturing plant to read and write real-time data using TCP/IP communication. The solution supports simultaneous communication with multiple devices, allows for future additions of communication protocols, and includes stubs and unit tests for testing TCP/IP communication.

## Features
- **TCP/IP Communication**: Supports communication using IP Address and Port Number for both reading and writing values.
- **Simultaneous Device Communication**: Capable of communicating with multiple devices at the same time.
- **Protocol Extensibility**: Designed to support future additions of different communication protocols.
- **Testing Stub**: Provides a stub to test TCP/IP communication.
- **Unit Test Cases**: Includes program/code-driven unit test cases.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.11.3
- Socket library (usually included with Python)
